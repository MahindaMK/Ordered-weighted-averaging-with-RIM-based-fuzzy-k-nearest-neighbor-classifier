# Ordered weighted averaging with RIM based fuzzy k nearest neighbor classifier
This repository offers the code for $${\color{blue} Ordered \space weighted \space averaging \space with \space regular \space increasing \space monotone-based \space fuzzy \space} $$ $${\color{blue} k-nearest \space neighbor \space (OWARIM-FKNN) \space classifier \space}$$

**Introduction:** <br/>
OWARIM-FKNN is an enhanced version of the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (FKNN) classifier, desinged to improve classification accuracy while dealing with outliers and data uncertainty issues. The method uses an ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator and RIM quantifier to create multiple local mean vectors for each class to generate class representative psudo-nearest neighbors. 

**Matlab functions:** <br/>
The code of the Md-FKNNreg algorithm (`owarim_fknn.m`) and related required functions `owamatrix.m` and `RIM.m` are included. In addition two example cases are also given.
